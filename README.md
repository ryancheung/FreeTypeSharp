## FreeType Wrapped

FreeType 2.11.0

# Installation

`dotnet add package FreeTypeSharp`

# Usage

There's no magic(abstraction) based on the original C freetype API. All managed API are almost identical with the original freetype C API. Import the namespaces like `using FreeTypeSharp.Native;` and `using static FreeTypeSharp.Native.FT;`, then you can play the font rendering as what you do in C.

Optionally, a facade `FreeTypeFaceFacade` was provided to handle some basic job. Feel free to use it.
